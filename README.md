## Summary
The vision is to drive an API implementation from a Swift Class that describes the  data. From this single definition: routes for a RESTfull CRUD interface will be generated in the Kitura server, including a mapping from the service routines to the database via the Swift-Kuery interface. 

## Status
Early design and exploration stage. Please provide comments and suggestions, jump in and help. 

## Resources
- ![Reflection](https://github.com/Zewo/Reflection) provides an API for advanced reflection at runtime including dynamic construction of types.
- ![Swift-Kuery](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-Kuery)SQL database abstraction layer
